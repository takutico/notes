##### Testing and continuous integration

Testing:
* Unit test
* API test
* Functional test

##### Story points
https://www.atlassian.com/agile/estimation

**Think before estimate:**
* Understand the business requirements
* UI Design
* Test
* Possibles errors
* Development time

**Notes:**
No individual task should be more than 16 hours of work. (If you're using story points, you may decide that, say, 20 points is the upper limit.)

##### Code review
https://www.atlassian.com/agile/code-reviews
* Are there any obvious logic errors in the code?
* Looking at the requirements, are all cases fully implemented?
* Are the new automated tests sufficient for the new code? Do existing automated tests need to be rewritten to account for changes in the code?
* Does the new code conform to existing style guidelines?

**Notes:**
Review before merging
Initiate a code review after all the code has been written and automated tests have been run and passed–but before the code is merged upstream.

##### User stories
User stories are sketched out by the product owner
* story points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100

##### Sprint
What is a sprint? In Scrum, teams forecast to complete a set of user stories during a fixed time duration, known as a sprint.

sprints are **one, two, or four weeks** long

**What is the sprint planning meeting?**
* Attendees: Required: development team, scrum master, product owner
* When: At the beginning of a sprint.
* Duration: Usually an hour per week of iteration – e.g. a two-week sprint kicks off with a two-hour planning meeting.
* Agile Framework: Scrum. (Kanban teams also plan, of course, but they are not on a fixed iteration schedule with formal sprint planning)
* Purpose: Sprint planning sets up the entire team for success throughout the sprint. Coming into the meeting, the product owner will have a prioritized product backlog. They discuss each item with the development team, and the group collectively estimates the effort involved. The development team will then make a sprint forecast that outlines how much work the team can complete from the product backlog. That body of work then becomes the sprint backlog.


**What is the daily standup meeting?**
* Attendees Required: development team, scrum master, product owner Optional: team stakeholders
* When: Once per day, typically in the morning
* Duration: No more than 15 minutes. Don't book a conference room and conduct the standup sitting down. Standing up helps keep the meeting short!
* Purpose: The daily standup is designed to inform everyone quickly of what's going on across the team. It's not a full status meeting. The tone should be light and fun, but informative. Have each team member answer the following questions:
    * What did I complete yesterday?
    * What will I work on today?
    * Am I blocked by anything?
* You can use the Active sprints of your Scrum board during the daily standup, so that each member can view the tasks they're working on.
