A day as a Scrum master or senior dev

**Junior Dev**
Stand-up 10am
60% of her time building out features on clients’ sites
15% of her time answering feasibility and functionality questions for members of the Accounts team
10% of her time troubleshooting issues when other team members are “stuck on some code craziness,”
15% assigning tasks to the members of her team

**Lead Dev**
an hour divvying up assignments to her team members

**Option 1**
9-10
emails
error logs
catch up (tech news)
online course

10-13
go through the list of tasks that are to be completed in the next sprint
1 being not complex at all and 8 being very complex
We have a certain amount of points available for each sprint, so the product manager prioritises the tasks so the critical tasks are done first.

14-16:30
Coding
deploy it to our test environment
run an automated regression test

**Option 2**
9-10am. I check email, jira, and pull requests
standup at 10:30 or 11 where we discuss what we did yesterday and what we are doing today
Then, my tasks for the day

**Option 3**
7:00 I check the issue-tracking tool to remind myself what I have to work on
08:00-10:00, pair programming when he knows what and how to do, he continues working on his own
